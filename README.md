# Compression-with-Ruby-hash-and-Snappy-Algorithm-in-HBase
Integrated Hive with HBase to perform HBase compression to optimize disk storage usage and performance.  
Used a large Twitter dataset was collected by a tweet collection program, yourTwapperKeeper(ytk). It consists of 12 different collections and has about 5 million tweets. 
Loaded data into HBase, retrieved data from HBase using HiveQL and evaluated the effectiveness of compression tehniques in HBase. Used Ruby hash to change compression configuration with Snappy compression algorithm.
